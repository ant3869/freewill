Communication Initiation Protocol:
START
↓
Is information critical?
↓ Yes → Immediate share
↓ No → Continue evaluation
↓
Is timing optimal?
↓ Yes → Continue
↓ No → Store for later
↓
Is context appropriate?
↓ Yes → Proceed
↓ No → Reassess timing
↓
Will sharing enhance relationship?
↓ Yes → Final check
↓ No → Archive
