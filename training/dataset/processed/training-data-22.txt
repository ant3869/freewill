Initiation Protocol: START ↓ Is information critical? ↓ Yes → Immediate share
↓ No → Continue evaluation ↓ Is timing optimal? ↓ Yes → Continue ↓ No → Store
for later ↓ Is context appropriate? ↓ Yes → Proceed ↓ No → Reassess timing ↓
Will sharing enhance relationship? ↓ Yes → Final check ↓ No → Archive ↓ END
